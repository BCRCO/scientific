<p><strong>1.1 Knowledge, Definition and Creation</strong></p>
<p>Since ancient times, philosophers wished to know not only what <strong>knowledge</strong> is, but how and from where does it arise. The research on the origin of knowledge has been one of the major topics of a discipline called epistemology. The word <strong>epistemology</strong> is derived from the Greek word <em>episteme</em> (knowledge) and the word <em>logos</em> (study). So the word is currently used to denote “the study of knowledge” or “justified belief”.
To answer what <strong>knowledge</strong> is from an epistemological point of view, you must first understand that there is not only one kind of knowledge. Although epistemology deals with different types of knowledge, such as knowing how to do something (e.g. playing an instrument), knowing something or somebody, it is more concerned with propositional knowledge. A proposition is something that can be expressed by a declarative sentence, and in this sentence the clause “that” is used: “She knows that a piano is a musical instrument”; “he knows that Moscow is the capital of Russia”. Propositional knowledge presents the general schema “subject knows that proposition”. In this last example, the subject is “he” and the proposition is “Moscow is the capital of Russia”. Propositional knowledge is the knowledge in a factual sense. This will help you understand where knowledge comes from and what are the necessary conditions for a subject to actually know or have knowledge of a certain proposition.
What are the necessary conditions for you to know that Moscow is the capital of Russia? There are several approaches to answer this. The traditional approach has three core elements to explain these conditions. If you do not believe that Moscow is the capital of Russia, then, this becomes a proposition that you don´t know. Knowledge requires belief. But not all beliefs constitute knowledge. You can be mistaken in what you believe. Therefore, knowledge requires truth. But these two criteria do not suffice to build up knowledge. It must be acquired the right way (through solid evidence and sound reasoning). A lucky guess do not constitute knowledge. A belief must be justified, and that’s the third ingredient to build up knowledge, justification. These three criteria build up the basic definition of <strong>knowledge</strong>, the “justified true belief” (Steup, 2005).

<p><strong>1.2 Difference between Science and Technology</strong>
Most of the time people speak about <strong>science</strong> and <strong>technology</strong> as if they were the same thing. You can see how new cell phones with new or improved characteristics reach the market, or that a drug to heal certain disease has been discovered. But, are you able to differentiate whether these accomplishments are achievements in science or technology? Science and technology have many similitudes, but they do differ.
The term knowledge is related to the term <strong>science</strong>. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2014), the word science comes from the Latin word <em>scientia</em>, which means “having knowledge” and from the verb <em>scire</em>, which means “to know” or “to be instructed”. Science is the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake while <strong>technology</strong> is the application of this scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life. To make it easier to grasp, technology is the application of the scientific knowledge in everyday life.
Differences between science and technology</p>
<p><strong>Science.</strong>
Science studies the functioning and array of DNA. 
Science studies the behavior of cancerous cells.
Chemistry studies the behavior of substances in nature and creates new materials.</p>
<p><strong>Technology.</strong>
Genetic engineering produces new varieties of crops.
Medical engineering develops new treatments for cancer.
New technologies are developed with new materials.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Classification of Sciences.</strong>
How many <strong>sciences</strong> do exist? Can you mention some sciences besides biology, chemistry, physics, social, and medical sciences? How are sciences classified? One of the most important classifications was done by the American philosopher Charles S. Peirce (1839-1914) in 1903.
Peirce proposed three classes of scientific inquiry, three great kingdoms of science (Burch, 2010):</p>
<p><strong>Science of discovery</strong>
Its sole aim is to discover new truth for its own sake. Within this group you can find mathematics, philosophy (cenoscopy), and special sciences (idioscopy), which are further divided into all the particular and special sciences, like physics, psychology, etcetera.
<strong>Science of review</strong>
Sets forth the science of discovery, so that it may serve any purpose. It deals with issues such as the history of science, the classification of sciences and the synthetic forms of philosophy; it deals with the arranging of the results of discovery.
<strong>Practical science</strong>
Discovers truth for the sake of some definite purpose. It comprises a form of scientific inquiry intended to fulfill genuine human needs, e.g. engineering, medical sciences, etcetera.</p>
<p>Peirce’s classification of sciences is one of the most noted classifications ever done. His classification, however, can only be valid if it is brought under constant revisions, since it is not able to comprise all the sciences that exist today and will exist in the future.</p>

<p><strong>2.1 The Scientific Research Process</strong>
There is no exclusive guideline on how to develop a <strong>research</strong> process. However, it must be agreed that research starts with an idea, a concern or a necessity born from the researcher’s curiosity; this moves the researcher to endeavor and enlighten the unknown. So, <strong>the research process</strong> has certain steps whose purpose is to conceive the research idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Conceive the research idea</strong>. The researcher thinks about a problem in nature, science or society that needs to be solved.</li>
<li>  <strong>Topic selection</strong>. The initial idea may be very wide and could encompass a lot of peripheral topics which may or may not be of interest for the researcher. In this step, a thorough bibliographic research must be done to narrow the original idea to the topic of interest.</li>
<li>  <strong>Establishment of the research’s objectives, questions and hypothesis</strong>. Once the researcher has refined his question and investigated the current knowledge on the topic through the bibliographic research, he may define the research’s objectives, questions (what is not known) and hypothesis (what the result is expected to be).</li>
<li>  <strong>Construction of the theoretical framework</strong>. The construction of the research’s theoretical context is aimed to extensively introduce the current situation of the problem in question. It includes a deep research in the bibliography.</li>
<li>  <strong>Design of the methodological strategy</strong>. In this step the ways to measure what has been conceptually defined are proposed: methods, techniques and instruments that will help you through your investigation. What you are going to do with the gathered information will also be defined here.</li>
<li>  <strong>Data gathering and interpretation</strong>. The data is interpreted and compared with the original research’s approaches.</li>
<li>  <strong>Report elaboration</strong>. The report, in which the objectives, questions and hypothesis are solved, is presented. This must contain the conclusions and results of the research that was done.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scientific <strong>research method</strong> can also be depicted in the following diagram.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ojsQ6PS.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>2.2 Research Methodology</strong>
Every approach and perspective involved in the research process as a whole is called a <strong>methodology</strong>. Methodologies intend to justify and answer questions of the research’s details, such as why and how; what data was collected and how it was analyzed. There are two main research philosophies, which encompass the different kinds of research methodologies, the positivistic and the phenomenological.</p>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Positivistic perspective</strong>. Also called quantitative, objectivist, scientific or experimentalist approach. This is the approach commonly used in science. Seeks to measure and evaluate phenomena and also explain them rationally.</li>
<li>  <strong>Phenomenological perspective</strong>. Also called qualitative, subjectivist, humanistic or interpretative approach. It is implemented in the description and explanation of events from the perspectives of the people who are the research’s subjects.
Research methodologies can be encompassed in the previous perspectives. There is no particular way to choose a given methodology; it rather depends on the researcher’s own interest, assumption and intentions (Neville, 2007).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positivistic or Empirical</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  Surveys</li>
<li>  Experimental studies</li>
<li>  Longitudinal studies</li>
<li>  Cross-sectional studies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phenomenological, Hermeneutical or Interpretative</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  Case studies</li>
<li>  Action research</li>
<li>  Participant observation</li>
<li>  Participative enquiry</li>
</ul>
<p>The methods or techniques needed are different according to the type of research. The following table describes these differences (Neville, 2007):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type of Research</th>
<th>Exploratory</th>
<th>Descriptive</th>
<th>Analytical</th>
<th>Predictive</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Description</td>
<td>It is undertaken when few or no previous studies exist. The aim is to look for patterns, hypotheses or ideas that can be tested and will form the basis for further research, e.g. the evolution theory was developed when no previous studies existed.</td>
<td>It can be used to identify and classify the elements or characteristics of the subject, e.g. number of days lost because of industrial action.</td>
<td>It often extends the descriptive approach to suggest or explain why or how something is happening, e.g. underlying causes of industrial action.</td>
<td>The aim is to speculate intelligently on future possibilities, based on close analysis of available evidence of cause and effect, e.g. predicting when and where future industrial action might take place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Methodology usually used</td>
<td>Typical research techniques would include case studies, observation and reviews of previous related studies and data.</td>
<td>Quantitative techniques are most often used to collect, analyze and summarize data.</td>
<td>An important feature of this type of research is in locating and identifying the different factors (or variables) involved.</td>
<td>This may require qualitative or quantitative techniques, including modeling.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>2.3 Three Approaches</strong>
Research can be approached in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Quantitative / Qualitative</strong>: that is if numerical data will be collected or other subjective information, aspects, values and perceptions will be analyzed.</li>
<li>  <strong>Basic / Applied</strong>: that means if knowledge will be improved without any particular applied purpose, or if the research is designed from the start to apply its findings.</li>
<li>  <strong>Deductive / Inductive</strong>: if general theories will lead to specific or particular situations by deduction, or if particular situations will be used to make or infer broad general ideas or theories (Neville, 2007).
Now you will focus on the first approach, “Quantitative or Qualitative”. Science methods are classified in these two branches or approaches. There is another branch called Mixed Approach, which involves both quantitative and qualitative methods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quantitative.</strong>
The emphasis of qualitative techniques is measuring, collecting and analyzing numerical data (e.g. range, scale, frequency) of phenomena.
This type of research is detailed, structured, precise and data can be easily collected and statistically treated.
These techniques are usually more expensive, since they require measuring devices or equipment. They are harder to design initially, and they are not used for deep study of the phenomenon, but only to get information on some research variables.
<strong>Qualitative.</strong>
It is more subjective in nature and involves examining and reflecting on the less tangible aspects of a research subject, e.g. values, attitudes, perceptions.
Its benefits include the following: easier to start, allows for deeper study in the phenomenon of interest, low cost, simple, participation of individuals with different experiences, can be used for more complex problems, etcetera.
However this kind of research is not as precise as the quantitative, its conclusions are not general and can be easily defeated or challenged.
<strong>Mixed.</strong>
Mixed research integrates or combines multiple methods, e.g. experiments or surveys with interviews, with the intention to draw on the strenghts of the qualitative and quantitative techniques.
It is used to understand real-life contextual phenomena using multi-level perspectives, cultural influences and different theoretical or philosophical positions; it is also used for interdisciplinary work.</p>
<p>Now you will focus on the first approach, “Quantitative or Qualitative”. Science methods are classified in these two branches or approaches. There is another branch called Mixed Approach, which involves both quantitative and qualitative methods.</p>
<h3 id="topic-3"><a class="anchor" name="topic-3" href="#topic-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Topic 3.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>3.1 Formulation of a Question</strong>
The interest on a <strong>topic</strong> is the starting point in every scientific research (Sabariego and Bisquerra, 2004). You will choose certain research topic depending on your own interests and expertise, but to continue with the research process, you must conceive a problem. The research problem is the materialization of the topic of interest and, unlike the latter, is researchable.
Kerlinger (1976) proposed the following guide criteria to formulate a <strong>research problem</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>  The implied phenomenon must be observable.</li>
<li>  It must handle at least two variables, in order to make its description more precise.</li>
<li>  Every person should understand what is being proposed. The problem must not leave unanswered doubts.</li>
<li>  It must be delimited.
The most common way of presenting and setting a problem is in the form of a question. According to Cardona (2002), a well-defined problem will help the researcher to define what is being studied (the research objectives), with whom (subjects), and how is the problem studied (variables).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VLbTSQr.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The following are some research questions that can be done depending on the kind of research:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type of Research</th>
<th>Questions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Descriptive</td>
<td>What is the phenomenon? How is it called? What is the relevance of the phenomenon? How often does it occur? What are its characteristics? Does it show always in one way or varies? Can it be analyzed in parts, sections or factors?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exploratory</td>
<td>Is there background information of this research topic? What characteristics does it show? What is really happening? What produces this phenomenon? Why is it necessary to experiment on it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Analytical</td>
<td>Is there any theoretical or practical explanation of it? Is it measurable? How does it evolve? How does it behave? Why does it exist? Where does it come from? What is the meaning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Predictive</td>
<td>What happens if you change or intervene in the phenomenon? Is it possible to modify it? What would happen if you modify it? Can it be controlled? Can we make it happen?</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>3.2 Justification and Viability</strong>
Another thing necessary for the research to be successful is to be <strong>justified</strong> and <strong>viable</strong>. Although the research’s basis, the questions it shall answer, its <strong>objectives</strong> and hypothesis may be correct and solid, not every person shares the same interest. What is important to somebody may not always be important to another person. <strong>Research</strong> needs to conceive a defined objective; it does not start from sudden personal whims.
There are several criteria to consider when proposing a research topic. The more questions answered the more solid the research’s <strong>justification</strong> will be. Not all the questions must be answered in order to the research to be justified.</p>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Convenience</strong>. What does the research work is for?</li>
<li>  <strong>Social relevance</strong>. Who will be benefitted with the research’s conclusions?</li>
<li>  <strong>Practical implications</strong>. Will the research help to solve a practical problem?</li>
<li>  <strong>Theoretical value</strong>. Will it fill a gap in knowledge?</li>
<li>  <strong>Methodological utility</strong>. Can the proposed research help to create a new way of recollecting or analyzing data?
If the project is correctly justified, then it is important to consider its viability; that is, if it’s capable of working, functioning and developing adequately; if it has enough changes to succeed and if it’s financially sustainable. A viable research project may comply with the following:</li>
<li>  The researcher can make and implement decisions.</li>
<li>  There is an adequate environment for the project.</li>
<li>  The results can be marketed or implemented.</li>
<li>  There are legal and ethical conditions for the research.</li>
<li>  Communications are effective.</li>
<li>  The project has enough financing</li>
<li>  The equipment or devices are available.
In general a research topic has to comply with the following four questions:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gY9Oxtj.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>3.3 Research Restrictions</strong>
Before starting a <strong>research</strong> project scientists have to evaluate the <strong>restrictions</strong> to the methods, technology, environment and other conditions under which the research will be done, in order to evaluate its viability. On the other hand a research project has to comply with the legal and ethical requirements imposed by the society or country where it will be done.
Do you imagine conducting a research these days as the Nazi regime or the Japanese army did on their war prisoners during World War II? How do you decide what must be researched and what must not? What are these restrictions?
When you hear the word <strong>ethics</strong>, you think of rules of distinguishing right from wrong, religious creeds or wise aphorisms. All the different societies in the planet have norms of conduct that distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Research also has prohibitions and restrictions, and in order to know whether or not something is “right or wrong” to research, you can refer to the research ethics, the discipline that study the ethic norms of research.
Despite any particular opinion, personal positions or points of view, it is important to adhere to ethical norms in research. It is banned, for example, to fabricate, falsify or misinterpret research data, since it violates the research aim of generating knowledge, truth, and avoid errors. It is also important to adhere to copyright guidelines, authorship, and patenting policies. Research norms will always promote and involve social values such as responsibility, respect for human rights, animal welfare, compliance with law, health and safety (Resnik, 2011).
The following chart contains some of the common <strong>restrictions</strong> when performing a research project:</p>

<h3 id="topic-4"><a class="anchor" name="topic-4" href="#topic-4"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Topic 4</strong></h3>
<p><strong>4.1 Literature Selection and Review</strong>
Before starting the construction of the <strong>theoretical framework</strong>, a deep search for the relevant bibliographical sources for the research topic must be done. These can be classified as follows (Sampieri, 1991):</p>
<ul>
<li>  Primary sources: books, scientific papers, specialized magazines, documentaries, etcetera. They are the direct source of information.</li>
<li>  Secondary sources: lists of primary sources, which can include a descriptive summary of the primary source. Example: internet searches.</li>
<li>  Tertiary sources: Documents that summarize names or titles of magazines and other periodical publications, newsletters, conferences, companies, and so on, that can give hints on where to look for sources.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literature</strong> can be found either in specialized libraries, internet, databases or magazines. Internet is a good source to look for secondary or tertiary sources, from which primary sources can be later obtained. It is recommended that the literature is at least five years old.
Another information source is to consult specialists and other professionals in the area, which can give valuable advice on your research intentions. It is a good idea to also know who are the most important researchers in your study field, which aspects have they researched, and if there is any researcher who has already done research in a similar context as yours.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Information Extraction</strong>
It is important to note if all the <strong>literature</strong> found meets your research needs. To identify and extract <strong>information</strong> for your research correctly, there are important recommendations and strategies to follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>  It is crucial to comprehend what is written and being read. Take a good time for reading.</li>
<li>  How do you determine in which sources a deep immersion is needed, and how to discard useless information? Before dealing deeply with academic texts, you can start reviewing its abstract, the index of contents, the conclusions or its cited sources. By doing this, you can decide if the aspects handled in the source are related with your research problem.</li>
<li>  When reading academic texts, more than only decodifying the written text or copying, it is important to comprehend it.</li>
<li>  You must be able to identify diverse opinions regarding a topic, to weight them, and to build up new perspectives from them.</li>
<li>  Make charts and concept maps of what you read.
There are different ways to read texts as described by Mateos (2009), according to the comprehension level:</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Reading level</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Reading strategies</th>
<th>Reader's Capabilities</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Local reading</td>
<td>To comprehend the keywords and ideas in the text separately and the local relationship between ideas.</td>
<td>The reader is involved only in local and superficial comprehension processes, establishing meaning relationships between words, comprehending separate ideas on the text and creating relationships between isolated consecutive ideas, in order to give sense to what is read.</td>
<td>To remember and to paraphrase ideas in the text. The reader sticks to the words in the text.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Global reading</td>
<td>To comprehend the global ideas in the text.</td>
<td>The reader is involved only in global processes: extracts the most important ideas from the text and builds relationships between these, in order to comprehend the main idea that integrates all the global ideas.</td>
<td>To summarize ideas and to organize them in a scheme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elaborative reading</td>
<td>To make inferences that go beyond the explicit ideas in the text.</td>
<td>This is a deeper reading level, in which the reader can go beyond the ideas written in the text, and build inferences, solve new problems and modify the previous knowledge.</td>
<td>To think with the text, not to read it only.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Critical reading</td>
<td>To comprehend, evaluate and to contrast perspective on a problem.</td>
<td>The reader recognizes that texts are never neutral or objective, but they reflect a particular perspective of the world and exclude other. There is an evaluation and comparison of different perspectives in order to build a new one.</td>
<td>To distinguish, evaluate and to create a personal viewpoint.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The researcher must be able to do, first, a local reading in order to screen for ideas; and then, at the last stage, a critical reading to extract ideas and contrast them. Therefore several readings may be necessary before writing a theoretical framework.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Theoretical Framework Construction</strong>
After a deep <strong>review of the literature</strong>, you can know if what you are intending to research already has a wide theoretical basis, or if you have to come to a new theoretical perspective from knowledge obtained from several theories. The strategies employed for the construction of your <strong>theoretical framework</strong> will depend in either case.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adopt an existing theory</strong><ul>
<li>  Because there was plenty of literature found, the problem has been adressed or researched several times before.</li>
<li>  You must try to always address the problem from a different and novel perspective, to avoid researching what is already known.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>  <strong>Setting forth a new theorical perspective</strong></li>
<li>  The literature found hints that there is not too much available information on the topic, and that the theories found are fuzzily related.</li>
<li>  You can choose one of the found theories as basis, and relate it with other complementary ideas also found during the literature review. In this way, you can come to creating a new theorical perspective of the situation.
The <strong>theoretical framework</strong> must be understood as a mean for explaining and situating the research problem in a given context, to set a “state of the art” of the research problem fundamental concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="topic-5"><a class="anchor" name="topic-5" href="#topic-5"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Topic 5</strong></h3>
<p><strong>5.1 Variables and Types of Relationships</strong>
A <strong>variable</strong> is a representation of any phenomenon that can take any value in order to dimension it. For example, in physics the letter T stands for temperature, and this variable can take different values (measured in Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees) in order to represent a physical reality.
There are several ways of classifying <strong>variables</strong>, and this classification depends on the relationships they form with other variables and with the research.</p>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Dependent variables</strong>, as their name suggest, depend on independent variables. For example, if a hypothesis states that “death rates increase with alcohol consumption”, the dependent variable will be the death rates, since it depends on the rates of alcohol consumption.</li>
<li>  <strong>Independent variables</strong> do not depend in any other variable and they can be active or attributive variables. Active variables can be manipulated by the researcher, whereas attributive variables cannot. In the previous example, the alcohol consumption is an attributive variable since it is inherent to the studied population. If the researcher could assign consumption rates to test different hypothesis, it would be an active variable.</li>
<li>  <strong>Strange variables</strong>. They can influence the dependent variables. They can be controllable, for example, when the researcher assign the values (sex, age, social condition of the alcohol consumers, etcetera.); or random variables, which values arise from random situations not controlled by the researchers.</li>
<li>  <strong>Mediation or moderation variables</strong>. They are related with dependent and independent variables, mediating their relationship and sometimes masking or affecting this relationship.
It is very important to identify the research variables of the studied problem in order to make a hypothesis based on one of them. For example, if you are going to analyze society’s opinion about people with tattoos, you may consider as research <strong>variables</strong> sex, age, social conditions, and education. These variables can affect the opinion about this topic, that is, people’s opinion may be affected by their age, sex or any other demographic variables. It is difficult to investigate about a certain matter considering several points of view, so the research topic has to be reduced to the least possible variables, and the rest of the variables must be in controlled conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JAfbUhg.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>5.2 Types of Hypothesis</strong>
As stated before, <strong>hypothesis</strong> are possible solutions or explanations to a given research problem. They can set a simple description of what is happening; for example, the hypothesis “in this lake there is a pollutant that has severe consequences on aquatic life”; or express a relation between the situation and a possible solution, for instance, “discharge controls can reduce the concentration levels of the pollutant in water”. This previous examples are <strong>conceptual hypothesis</strong>. <strong>Operational hypothesis</strong> occur when including the conceptual hypothesis and the variables involved.
<strong>Statistical hypothesis</strong> are those which build up a mathematical expression. In this context, you can introduce the null and the alternative hypothesis. The <strong>null hypothesis</strong> is the “main hypothesis”, the one that is being tested. The <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong>, as the name suggests, becomes a possible consequence if the null hypothesis fails to be proven.
Imagine the following <strong>null hypothesis</strong>: students from public schools obtain the same grades as students from private schools. If you prove that this is not true, then you would have to take the <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong>: the students from public schools score better than those from private schools or the other way around. Depending on which score results higher during the data collection, is the <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> chosen.
On the other hand, qualitative research employs open <strong>hypothesis</strong>, especially for observational research designs. For interpretation work, the term <strong>work hypothesis</strong> is used. So, depending on the kind of research that will be done and on the identified variables, the researcher must choose a specific hypothesis.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nB5HLYC.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>5.3 Hypothesis Definition and Prediction</strong></p>
<p>A hypothesis and a prediction are not the same. A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is an explanation of a phenomenon, while the <strong>prediction</strong> is the logical consequence of the hypothesis; that is, the expectation derived from the <strong>hypothesis</strong>. Hypothesis can be tested, falsifiable (proven to be false) and concrete.
The following examples illustrate the differences between a hypothesis and a prediction.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Hypothesis</th>
<th>Prediction (in consequence)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>You hypothesized that immediate feedback would increase long-term retention of course material.</td>
<td>You predicted that students given immediate feedback on course exams would show higher final-exam performance compared to students given feedback two days later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You hypothesized that, owing to its effects on the frontal-lobe and hippocampus, alcohol consumption would impair long-term memory.</td>
<td>You predicted that subjects who drank six or more ounces of alcohol would recall significantly fewer names than students given a placebo beverage.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong> may be useful to predict phenomena in nature, society, populations, bodies, or other parts of the world. If confirmed or proved to be true they will add applicable knowledge to science, which is the final purpose of scientific research.</p>
